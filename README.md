# hapi

This is the hitran.org Python API for the HITRAN database.
This software can be downloaded at http://hitran.org/hapi/

Because I got surprised by un-announced difference between the version I downloaded in April 2015 and my colleague who downloaded their version in June/July 2015, I decided to archive versions here and add an installer so that people can just do

```python
python setup.py install
```
to add it to their environment.
